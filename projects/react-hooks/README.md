# React Hooks


## Mini Project 1: useContext

**Objective:** Learn how to use the useContext hook to manage global state.

**Project:** Create a simple theme switcher app. Users can toggle between light and dark themes. Use useContext to share the theme state across multiple components.

## Mini Project 2: useReducer

**Objective: ** Explore state management with the useReducer hook.

**Project: ** Build a basic shopping cart application. Use useReducer to manage the cart's state, including adding and removing items, and calculating the total price.

## Mini Project 3: useMemo and useCallback

**Objective:** Optimize your components using useMemo and useCallback.

**Project:** Build a memoized calculator app. Use useMemo to avoid re-calculating results when the input values haven't changed. Use useCallback to prevent re-creating event handler functions for each input field.

## Mini Project 4: Custom Hooks

**Objective:** Build your own custom hooks for reusable logic.

**Project:** Create a custom hook for managing form state and validation. Use this hook to handle form input values, validation rules, and error messages in a form component.

## Mini Project 5: useRef

**Objective:** Understand how to use the useRef hook for DOM manipulation.

**Project:** Create an auto-scrolling news ticker. Use useRef to control the scrolling behavior and pause scrolling when a user hovers over the news.


## Mini Project 6: useLayoutEffect

**Objective:** Explore the useLayoutEffect hook for layout-related tasks.

**Project:** Develop a custom tooltip component that displays additional information about a hovered item. Use useLayoutEffect to position the tooltip accurately based on the item's position.

## Mini Project 7: useImperativeHandle

**Objective:** Learn how to use useImperativeHandle for customizing a child component's API.

**Project:** Create a modal dialog component that can be controlled from a parent component. Use useImperativeHandle to expose methods for showing and hiding the modal.



## Mini Project 8: Debugging with useDebugValue

**Objective:** Practice adding debugging information to custom hooks.

Project: Enhance your custom hook from the previous project by adding debugging labels using useDebugValue. This will make it easier to understand the hook's behavior when inspecting it in React DevTools.
